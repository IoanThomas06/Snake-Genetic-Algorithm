The program here was designed as part of an A-Level project.

The program represents an example implementation of the library/API MlApi.Snake, which can be found on NuGet here: https://www.nuget.org/packages/MLAPINET.Snake/.

The program also makes use of MathNet.Numerics, NuGet: https://www.nuget.org/packages/MathNet.Numerics/.

The program implements a genetic algorithm which can be used to train a feed forward neural network to play Snake.
A partially trained example is included through the other .txt files, the file names will include 'NNBrainKiddo'. Place all of these in the debug bin to be able to load the brain.

An accompanying word document will be included at some point to show the training and design of the machine learning model.
